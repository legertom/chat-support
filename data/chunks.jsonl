[Overview](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/000001448?language=en_US#header1) \n2. [Features](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/000001448?language=en_US#header2) \n3. [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/000001448?language=en_US#header3)\n\nAnnouncing API V3.0! Clever’s newest API version simplifies data management for partners and districts. The next-generation API offers a new flexible data model to help partners meet the fast-evolving and unique needs of their district customers in a scalable way.\n\n---\n\nAPI v3.0 will include the following features:\n\nIn v1.0 and v2.0, users with multiple roles had a Clever ID for each role. This could often be confusing in downstream applications where users might have duplicate accounts or struggle to access the correct account. API v3.0 provides flexible user-role data to streamline the experience of provisioning teachers, staff, and contacts so applications can quickly scale access for all users on their platform. If a user has multiple leadership roles (at the district, school, or teacher level), they will now have a single Clever ID.\n\nThis updated data model will not be very noticeable in the Clever Dashboard or Portal. Users with multiple roles will still have separate Portals in Clever. However, downstream applications will now be able to identify users with various roles and link those accounts accordingly. Some applications will also allow users to toggle between accounts.\n\nWe’re adding even more granularity to our contact relationships to make it easier for partners to support and connect with family members. If a contact is a parent to two children, has a nephew in the district, and is an emergency contact for a family friend, they’ll have one Clever ID, and you’ll be able to see those unique relationships with every student.\n\nContact data will be more accurate and relationship types will be much less rigid. This update recognizes the complexity of the different types of relationships individuals may have as students' contacts. This change will address the security risks of assigning only one relationship type to a contact who may otherwise have other relationship types with other students.\n\nAPI v3.0 will support a consistent experience for how districts and applications refer to Staff (formerly ‘School Admins’).\n\nFurthermore, role types for Staff will now be available through the API, making it easy to distinguish between the different levels of permissions Staff have in Clever (e.g., School Tech Lead vs. Portal-Only).\n\nThis update will improve the alignment between how our school district and application partners communicate about staff users. By updating the way we refer to this user type in the API, we hope to close the loop on some miscommunication that occurs when rostering staff users.\n\nIn addition, exposing the staff role field in the Clever API will give application partners more flexibility in provisioning account permissions.\n\nSome applications allow you to map resources to specific courses, classes, or users. This often requires district administrators to work with each application directly to assign these resources manually. To address this pain point, we’ve created a feature that helps you manage content mapping directly from your Clever Dashboard!\n\nTo learn more about content assignment, check out this article: [For Clever Admins: Content Mapping.](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360052615892)\n\n---\n\n**When can we expect to see these changes?**\n\n- It is up to each application to decide when to adopt the new API version. Even for our early adopters, it will take some time to implement these changes and migrate their data over. If you would like to know more about how an application will utilize our new API, we recommend reaching out to them directly.\n\n**How will I know what version of the API the application is on?**\n\n- You can always reach out to Clever Support for more information about the API version an application uses. However, how each application uses v3.0 will be up to them. Clever doesn't guarantee any specific user experience changes as a result of this new API version release. If you have more specific questions, we recommend reaching out to the application directly.", "tokens_estimate": 1096, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:25:28.976833+00:00", "content_hash": "7cf40fb8928b9e88762454d23142dee4b1fbf83605eded7a2a4c3c8a24f90010"}

When sending emails asking for reviews, include some tips, ideas, or guidance on how to get the most out of using your application. View sample messaging here . Optimize the timing of when you ask teachers for reviews. Consider timing your ask around when the teacher has used your product independently or with students, within a certain number of days after logging into your application, or during a time when they're likely to engage with your product. Send one review request per teacher. If a teacher doesn't respond to your request for a review, don't send them a second request. > Guidelines\n> Be open to all types of feedback. Teachers trust the feedback of other teachers, so having a range of reviews on your application gives you an opportunity to establish trust and authenticity with your users, in addition to receiving valuable product feedback. Per FTC guidelines , don't offer money or prizes in exchange for reviews. If you offer an incentive for teachers to leave reviews, you must instruct the reviewer to indicate that this was an incentivized endorsement. > Clever is excited to be a trustworthy source of teacher reviews.

Updates occur when a user's first name, last name, user type, or organization unit changes. When updating a user, the following fields are synced:\n\n- User first name (if changed)\n- User last name (if changed)\n- Organizational unit as configured by the district (if changed)\n- Suspension status\n - Suspended if a user exists in the Google Directory under a managed OU but not in the most recent Clever dataset.\n - Unsuspended if a user was previously suspended (i.e., not in the Clever dataset) but has been restored in the Clever dataset within 300 days.\n- Archive management\n - Users with free Fundamentals, Fundamentals-archive, and Gmail-only licenses will have their archive behavior managed by Clever IDM. Users with paid licenses will have their archive status managed via the [Google License Manager](https://schools.clever.com/license-manager).\n - You'll be able to select the archive behavior of users with a free license to one of three options in Clever IDM:\n - Move to archive OU, suspend, and archive\n - Move to archive OU and suspend\n - Move to archive OU\n - For Gmail-only licenses, we recommend having IDM move the users into an OU with automatic license assignment turned on for the Gmail-only license. Clever IDM does not directly manage Gmail-only licenses.\n\nIf you have questions or comments about the visibility of these attributes or would like additional attributes to be set by IDM, please contact Clever Support.\n\n---\n\nWe now provide SFTP access to user emails managed by Clever IDM.

Do the sharing rules you have in place now work for the coming semester’s data as well? This is a great time to ensure that your district is sharing all necessary courses with Google Classroom. Need help with sharing rules? Clever Support can help. Many districts prefer to share only the current term's sections to avoid confusion for their teachers. See the term rollover article for more information. > Step 3: Let your teachers know what to expect! > This is one of the most important steps! For a great rollout, make sure your teachers know the following three things:\n> When they should see courses populated in Google Classroom (and what they look like - see below). Google Classroom courses should be synced within about an hour after your teacher access date arrives. When students will be added to those courses. If your student access date is after your teacher access date, make sure to let teachers know when students will be added - so they don't add them on their own and are prepared for when they appear! That they need to \"accept\" courses for them to be editable and visible to students. Courses that aren't accepted will not be visible to anyone except their primary teacher. >    \n> Step 4: Monitor the sync history page for errors and successfully-synced data\n> Navigate to the Sync History page for Google Classroom roster import  to monitor the courses that are being created and updated. Be sure to review any sync error reports, including the reason and resolution for any sync issues. >  Please note: When sections match, we may or may not have updated the class.

If you need to reprovision any courses that teachers declined or archived by accident, Clever Admins can do that from the section's profile page in the Clever Dashboard:   An example screenshot of what the course will look like if declined. > Customize course names\n> If the default naming convention or a previous year’s customized naming convention needs to be changed during rollover, you can utilize the course naming tool from the Google Classroom roster import settings page in your Clever Dashboard. These changes will only be reflected in courses created in future syncs and will not overwrite previously synced courses. If courses are created and already in use, the names will not update dynamically when using the custom course naming feature. > Teachers can customize course names\n> If a teacher has courses with the same name syncing due to a previous year or term's course having the same name as a new course, the teacher can change one of the course names manually to differentiate them. The sync will not overwrite any changes the teacher makes to the course name. > Disable student access to Google Classroom in the Google Workspace Admin Console\n> If you do not set a pause during a rollover period (e.g., summer, winter) students will be able to see schedules as soon as the teacher accepts their course in Google Classroom.

These fields will appear on the associated record as an extension field.\n\nFull documentation for supporting extension fields can be found in our [Dev Docs](https://dev.clever.com/docs/extension-fields).\n\nIn order to receive extension fields, you'll need to add the fields to the list of fields you will accept in your Data Access settings ([Settings > Data Access](https://apps.clever.com/clever-academy-dev/settings/data-access)). You'll need to mark the **ext** field as optional for any record types you'll support.\n\nAdditionally, a district will need enable access to extension fields from their Clever Dashboard under the **Settings > Field Access** for your application. Once the district has enabled access, the data will be available to your application in the Clever API.\n\nBecause fields are created and populated by the district outside of our schema, we cannot normalize the data within the field.

Matching Clever IDM will attempt to match users in one of two ways. First, it will take the user’s Clever username and match it against existing UserPrincipalNames in Active Directory. If a Clever user doesn’t have a username populated, Clever IDM will use the UserPrincipalName defined in the “Set login credentials step” and search for identical UserPrincipalNames in Active Directory.

This value is important as it ensures that every student, teacher, section, etc. on Clever has a unique ID across all active schools on Clever. Since it is globally unique, most application partners use the Clever ID as the primary identifier for a record when pulling data from Clever.\n\nClever IDs are an alpha-numeric string that is generated by Clever and can be viewed on the profile page for a record.\n\nClever IDs are directly connected to the following primary ids provided by the district to Clever. For more information on Clever's field specifications, please see this [document](https://schools.clever.com/files/clever-sftp.pdf).\n\n- Record Type: Primary ID Field\n- School: School\\_id\n- Staff: Staff\\_id\n- Teacher: Teacher\\_id\n- Student: Student\\_id\n- Section: Section\\_id\n\n---\n\nChanges in Clever IDs are the result of the primary id field for the record being changed. If the primary id field is changed for a record, a new Clever ID will be provisioned. For example:\n\n**IF \n             Student A** is uploaded from the SIS to Clever with **Student\\_id: 1234**. \n**THEN** \n       A new student record with **Student\\_id: 1234 / Clever ID: 53446ae050bb279fb03d2a3e** is created.\n\n**IF** \n**Student A** is updated in the SIS and uploaded from the SIS to Clever with **Student\\_id: 5678**. \n**THEN** \n             Student record with **Student\\_id: 1234 / Clever ID: 53446ae050bb279fb03d2a3e** is deleted.           \n             A new student record with **Student\\_id: 5678 / Clever ID: 54d263946cc968010000007a** is created.\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 504, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:26:14.098251+00:00", "content_hash": "7c9e71fe9c782140b8e4d5808ded0afce5de452b8904cf3a1d2eb023105a9a93"}

If you’ve already set up sharing for an application and need to use the same sharing settings for another application, you can copy the settings over to simplify your setup process. When you use copy sharing, Clever will take the sharing settings from the source application and apply them to the new application.

When sharing by rules, Clever will only share data that meets the specific criteria you've set. This is the most recommended sharing type as it provides districts with the flexibility in determining specifically what data should be included, or excluded, in the sharing.\n\nAdditionally, applications are dynamically updated as new data is synced to Clever from your district's student information system (SIS).

[Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/000001512?language=en_US#FAQ)\n\nSync field mappings refer to the relationship between fields from a student information system (SIS) and fields in Clever. A field mapping is when you specify the field in your SIS that you want to map to a specific data value in Clever. For example, Clever accepts student\\_email as a data value. Depending on the field (e.g., emailaddress.emailaddress, SchoolEmail, etc.)  in which you store emails in your SIS, you may want to map a specific field to the student\\_email field.\n\n**![](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Pl000000TBbB&feoid=00N1P00000A2RcS&refid=0EM1P0000028C4p)**For **SFTP syncs**, Clever has an SFTP web upload feature with field mapping!

This page shows the relationship between each Clever Field & SIS Field.\n\nClever Field refers to the data field in Clever where the SIS data is being stored.\n\nSIS Field refers to the name of the field in the SIS where the data is being pulled from. In the below screenshot, we can see that for students, School\\_id is being synced from HomeSchoolId³. If the SIS Field is followed by **(custom mapping)**⁴, it means the mapping was added custom for your account. If the SIS field is blank⁵, Clever is not pulling any information from the SIS for the corresponding Clever Field.\n\n**Edit⁷** indicates that Clever Admins may customize which SIS field to sync to the corresponding Clever Field. If the value you are looking for is unavailable from the dropdown, please contact Clever Support with the exact name of the SIS field you want to map, and our team will investigate whether the mapping is supported. If the **Action** field is blank⁸, the SIS Field either is not customizable or requires a Clever Support team member to customize the field for your account. Contact Clever Support to learn about your available options.\n\nUse the view record type selectors to view the mappings for each record type.

Preserving access\n> Overview\n> Clever IDM is built to work seamlessly with your existing summer rollover practices – from preparing for summer school, to getting ready for back to school, to preserving access for graduated students. This article is your guide for what to expect and the tools and processes you can use to customize Clever IDM – and Clever, more broadly – to fit your needs. > Default Behavior\n> Clever syncs are set to pause at the end of the school year and unpause just before the back to school season. See this article for more on sync pauses and when default sync pause dates are set for this year. When your sync is paused, data in Clever won’t be automatically modified or changed. By default, Clever IDM’s nightly syncs will continue to run. Since there are no automatic data updates happening in Clever, most of the time Clever IDM syncs won’t have any impact. There are two exceptions:\n> Custom data . If your district modifies custom data in Clever during your sync pause, Clever IDM will sync newly created or modified users to your identity provider. Manual changes in a destination. If someone in your district manually updates users in Google or Active Directory, Clever IDM may revert those changes on its next sync – if they conflict with Clever data. For example, if you move a Clever-managed user to a new OU in Google, Clever IDM will move that user back to its original OU during the next sync. Note: this is only true for users that Clever IDM actively manages. Clever IDM will not make any changes to users that it doesn’t manage. >  \n> Pausing Clever IDM syncs\n> If you would like Clever IDM’s nightly syncs to pause during this time, please use the “Pause <destination> Syncs” button, found on the IDM dashboard.", "tokens_estimate": 496, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:26:21.738440+00:00", "content_hash": "c250fcaa3f1ba475dd81e9de9611d45574b1d7e21b2e9d8fcada8cb6199d3300"}

You can resume Clever IDM syncs at any time. > Learn more about pausing IDM syncs here . >  \n> Options for syncing during the summer\n> Some districts may want Clever IDM to automatically create and manage accounts for users over the summer. The easiest way to manage this is through the use of custom data. Our Summer School: Overview  article includes a comprehensive guide for how to manage summer school data in Clever. Any users added via custom data will be automatically synced through Clever IDM’s nightly syncs. If custom data isn’t a good option for your district, you can consider delaying your sync pause so that summer school data is updated in Clever before your pause starts. In some cases, it may make sense to not pause your Clever sync at all. For example, if you’d like to continue syncing staff and teachers to Clever – so they have their accounts created – but don’t want to use custom data. Districts using an SFTP sync can achieve this by continuing to sync the teachers.csv and staff.csv but temporarily pausing the syncing of all other files. We recommend discussing this option with the Clever team so you understand the implications. Lastly, as need be, you can manually provision users in Google, Entra ID, or Active Directory while your sync is paused. When your sync resumes, Clever IDM will match the newly created users and begin to manage them. >  \n> Back to school\n> Once your sync is unpaused for the coming school year, new data will begin flowing into Clever and old data will be removed. Once the data for the upcoming year is successfully synced, Clever IDM will update data in Google, Entra ID and/or Active Directory accordingly.

Clever IDM allows you to configure each destination independently, so you can select whichever user types you’d like to be managed for each destination. If you’d like to filter down users by school or grade level for a given destination, reach out to Clever Support and we can help.\n\n**Can we keep the passwords the same across multiple destinations?**\n\n- Clever IDM will set passwords based on your chosen convention whenever accounts are created. Clever IDM also supports random passwords across multiple destinations. Once one destination is configured, you’ll see the option to use that destination’s password in other destinations.\n- School districts using Clever IDM can also enable [recovery and reset](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/000001613) functionality for any connected destinations.\n\n![Screenshot of the password format setup for IDM](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Pl000000TmfZ&feoid=00N1P00000A2RcS&refid=0EMPl000002Z3Bb)\n- Once accounts are created, passwords can be managed via Clever.

Clever IDM charges based on the total number of managed users, regardless of how many destinations we manage. The only case where adding another destination will increase the cost of Clever IDM is if you use the new destination to manage users that aren’t already being managed by the first destination you configured.\n\n**Can I add two different destinations of the same type?**\n\n- We support multiple destinations of the same type, e.g., you can use Clever IDM to sync users to two or more Active Directory, Entra ID, or Google Workspaces servers. If you’re interested in this feature, reach out to [implementation@clever.com](mailto:implementation@clever.com).\n\n**I use Google Directory sync and Google Password sync to keep my AD and Google in sync. Should I still keep that running if I set up IDM for both?**\n\n- Clever IDM will manage users and their placement in OUs in Google. If those are the only things you use Google Directory Sync to manage in Google Workspace, running it in tandem with Clever IDM is unnecessary.\n- If there are other elements, like Groups or Passwords, that you use Google Directory Sync to keep in sync between AD and Google, we recommend you continue to use GDS alongside Clever IDM. **Ensure you only use GDS to sync the data Clever IDM isn’t already managing.**\n\nIf you still need support or have additional questions, please reach out to [support.clever.com](https://support.clever.com/).", "tokens_estimate": 678, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:26:24.439984+00:00", "content_hash": "243025bcb8adb0e805e6da9800e38e96122c028aae3b3a375322add2012d046f"}

When enabling schools in EBSCO Experience Manager, you will need to know if any schools should be enabled in their own EBSCO account, or if all schools can be enabled in the district account.\n\nThe easiest way to decide is to find out if any schools in your district have subscribed to EBSCO products just for their school. If they have, you will need to enable those schools in their own EBSCO accounts. This way, users at those schools will have access to their school’s unique content as well as any shared content across the district.\n\nIf none of your schools have their own subscriptions, you can enable every school in the district’s EBSCO account.\n\nFor help with this, you can [contact EBSCO support](https://connect.ebsco.com/s/article/How-do-I-contact-EBSCO-Support), ask your school or district librarians, or reach out to your district’s EBSCO administrator.

Below are a few items to take into consideration when choosing if your school should manage its own Clever account. \nNOTE \n**If your SIS is managed by a separate team (e.g. a school district or charter school network), you will want to reach out to that team to consider the following information together.**\n\n---\n\nIf you share an SIS account with a district or group of schools, you'll need to know how to export and upload just your school’s data.\n\nThis can be done via an [SFTP Sync](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/205783078), but you may need to work with the district or charter network team to ensure just your school’s data is exported. Clever isn't able to provide guidance on the export process from your SIS when using an SFTP sync.\n\n​\n\n---\n\nAre you currently syncing data to any applications through the existing Clever account? If so, please contact your application representative if you are anticipating a change to your existing Clever account. Creating a new Clever account will provision users with new Clever IDs, potentially impacting historical data within connected applications.\n\n​\n\n---\n\n​If you have any students or teachers currently accessing an existing district account, Clever won't be able to preserve historical data across these accounts.  Individual application partners may be able to assist, but you will need to reach out to them directly.\n\nAdditionally, if you have students who are highly transient (move between schools in the district or charter network frequently), please consider that these students will not have data preserved as they potentially move between Clever accounts.\n\n---\n\nIf multiple schools share a Google Admin Console, Badges into Chromebooks can only be supported for one Clever account. The setup for Badges into Chromebooks requires the unique sign-in/sign-out URL for Clever, and this can only be input in Google once.\n\nClever Admin cannot have the same email address on multiple Clever accounts. If you wish to have the same admins on multiple accounts, a unique email address will be necessary for each account.\n\n​\n\n---\n\nMany large districts prefer to use the School Tech Lead role to help manage individual school accounts within a larger district account.\n\nSchool Tech Leads have additional permissions such as the ability to customize their school’s Clever Portal, utilize School Site Sharing to control their school’s sharing rules for applications, and help with troubleshooting logins for users in their school. For more information on School Tech Leads please see our articles [Clever Roles: School Tech Lead](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115003207663?language=en_US) and [Sharing Permissions: Enabling School Site Sharing for School Tech Leads](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115001972366?language=en_US).\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 1007, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:26:34.583681+00:00", "content_hash": "36e3adaa52059da9e2402bea9b9e23f9a708b1a0aac3b6613120ad3aa5703c9f"}

At that time, Clever will compare the data in Clever to the accounts in Google/AD/Entra and create, update, or archive users appropriately.\n\nThere may be some reason that you want to temporarily pause your nightly Clever IDM sync, though. This article will walk you through the process of pushing, pausing, and resuming your Clever IDM syncs.\n\n---\n\nTo initiate a manual sync of IDM:\n\n1. Navigate to [Clever Dashboard > User Management > IDM.](https://schools.clever.com/identity-management)\n2. Click on the desired destination.\n3.

Pause your sync while you understand what the issue is. Resume your sync once you have identified the issue.\n- Making big changes to your Clever sync (summer rollover, semester rollover, changing an SIS)? Pause your sync. When the majority of your changes are complete, resume the sync. This will ensure that you don’t have too many rapid, unnecessary changes in your provisioned Google/Active Directory/Entra accounts while the SIS changes are happening.\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 522, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:26:37.459549+00:00", "content_hash": "0f14cec3c26317c3c7d9d232036678ffbfd94225596b4f282678221264298111"}

The exact process will depend on the sync type you have set up to connect your Student Information System (SIS) to Clever. If you need help syncing the data from your SIS into Clever in the correct format, contact Clever Support by clicking the blue chat box in the bottom right corner of the Help Center. The names of the Clever extension fields that the MAP system accepts are listed in the right-hand column in the table below. The data you'll enter in the CSV file to assign a particular student to a program will be the exact Custom Name of the program you have listed in the MAP system. Let's look at an example of students who are assigned different programs in Clever (via extension fields) that will then be sent over to MAP as a Standard Name or Custom Name:     In the above example, you see that:\n> Student 123 will be assigned to two programs in MAP: the Remote Learning program and the Gifted and Talented program. Student 456 will also be assigned to the Remote Learning program, as well as the Section 504 program. Student 789 is assigned to two programs in MAP: the Remote Learning and Economically Disadvantaged programs. >  \n> Step 5: Share data with NWEA\n> Now that the data is synced to Clever, you can share the data with NWEA. The instructions for sharing custom fields in Clever can be found here . Since these fields are considered sensitive, you must provide special permission for Clever to share these fields with MAP. Refer to For District Admins: Syncing Sensitive Fields (i.e., ELL status, IEP status, FRL status) for instructions. > Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n> Can I add multiple “other” programs as Clever Extension Fields? > For example, a district might have a program with a Custom Name in MAP called “Volleyball” and another program with a Custom Name called “Economically Disadvantaged”.", "tokens_estimate": 497, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Applications", "Applications", "Applications", "Applications", "Applications", "Application Guides", "Application Guides", "Application Guides", "Application Guides", "Application Guides"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:26:41.345424+00:00", "content_hash": "ab5c8bc0ace639308ab36506f7b5adf2c4e0bdc1e45f06e0b6d6eb589f49988a"}

The Clever ID is what creates the user and school accounts in Clever and in most connected applications. For this reason, Clever does not recommend changing SIS IDs, especially during a school year. We recommend all SIS ID changes be made in the summer between academic years. > If an SIS ID change is being requested by an application partner: Clever Support can update the data available to the application without affecting the core data in Clever or the data available to other applications.

These allow you to build a format for many different products in Clever - from IDM email addresses to SSO (Saved Passwords) application credentials and many other places in the Clever Dashboard . These formulas work all across Clever - so if you’re setting up Clever IDM for Google, Active Directory, or even Entra ID, you’ll still be able to transform data into the format you need! >  \n> Building formulas\n> Easily tailor formulas with Clever IDM's format builder. This intuitive tool guides you through crafting formats for IDM fields like sub-OUs and login credentials. Choose between the standard block builder for simplicity or the advanced format editor for more customization. > Please note: The block builder approach for building formats doesn’t currently support extension fields or advanced use of functions. If you need to use your extension fields or write more complex functions that you know Clever supports but don’t see as an option, you’ll need to use the advanced option of entering a format string.

This article will guide you through reviewing and cleaning up your team.\n\nTo view your Clever team, navigate to the [Clever Dashboard > User management > Admin team](https://schools.clever.com/team/members).\n\n---\n\nYour Clever administrative team may include users with one of the following roles: Clever Admin (Owner), Clever Admin, District Curriculum Lead, District Help Desk, or a [Custom Role](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/000001702) that you've created in the Clever Dashboard. To learn more about the default admin team roles, [see this article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115001733726).\n\nSchool Tech Leads (STLs) are not admin users. School Tech Leads are staff users with additional permissions in Clever, allowing them to provide support and troubleshoot for your schools. [Learn more about School Tech Leads here](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115003207663).\n\n---\n\nThe Clever Admin Owner holds unique privileges and is designated as the primary point of contact for all Clever-related issues.

Before making any changes to your team, consider whether you are using the default admin rostering in any of your connected applications. If you are, any users added to the team will be shared with these applications, and any users removed will lose access to these applications. If you’re considering removing team members, consider adding them as staff users to Clever and sharing them with the appropriate applications so they maintain application access if needed.\n\nLearn about [Customizing District Admin field access here](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360000501586#four).\n\nLearn about [Staff users](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/229253547) here.\n\n---\n\nWhen reviewing your team, you can edit which role your users have.

Check out your specific sync type in the list below, and pay close attention to any field limitations or the timings of automated syncs.\n\n- [Which sync type should I choose?](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/202289278)\n- [SFTP](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/205783078?language=en_US)\n- [Aeries](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/203005016?language=en_US#five)\n- [PowerSchool](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/000001590)\n- [Infinite Campus Auto](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/202094756?language=en_US#Header4)\n- [Infinite Campus API](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/226677767?language=en_US#troubleshooting)\n- [SchoolInsight](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/206090237)\n- [Skyward API](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/232211028?language=en_US#h_01EHB1XM013ZNM5DNARJXQPZ5N)\n- [Blackbaud API Sync](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/000001544?language=en_US)\n\nFor instance, if your sync type doesn't automatically include student emails, you should review our options for populating that field, such as field mapping.

Reusing an ID within 300 days of its last sync can cause data issues both within Clever and connected applications. Confirm with your SIS admin that IDs won’t be recycled. If your SIS reuses IDs automatically, assign unique identifiers that haven’t synced with Clever in the past 300 days. Populate data in your new SIS.

This article details the process for resetting an app team member's password.\n\nThis only applies to app partners who log in with an email address and password. App partners who log in with Sign in with Google or App Dashboard SSO should reset their IDP passwords in their IDP.\n\n---\n\nClever requires a certain level of complexity to ensure a strong password and also does privacy-preserving checks.\n\nDuring account creation, password reset, and login, Clever will determine if a password is unsafe if it's been made public in an unrelated data breach. If an app team member’s password is determined unsafe, we require the user to select a different password.\n\nFor recommendations on selecting strong passwords, see the FAQ.\n\n---\n\nTo reset your app team member password for Clever,\n\n1. Visit [apps.clever.com](https://apps.clever.com/) and click Forgot your password?\n2. Enter the email address associated with your admin account, click the Captcha, and click Reset\n3. An email will be sent with a link to reset your password. If you don't receive the email, please check your spam filter and make sure [no-reply@clever.com](mailto:no-reply@clever.com) is added as a contact to your email account.\n\nQuick link: <https://apps.clever.com/reset?captcha=true>\n\n---\n\nIf you'd like to update your Clever password, click on your name in the top-right of the app dashboard and click Profile Settings. Enter your existing password and new password and then click Update to update your password.\n\n![Profile page with Profile Settings and Change Password sections highlighted](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Pl000000ULWr&feoid=00N1P00000A2RcS&refid=0EM1P0000063MMZ)\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 589, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:27:11.786450+00:00", "content_hash": "2e669f21e2970a49d4493c5b558a325fd5e78b2b071af801ae55b24bebec4b48"}

You can avoid oversharing staff with your other applications by setting your other apps to [**Share by Rules**](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115000392247) and making sure only to include the appropriate staff users.\n\nYou'll also want to utilize Share by Rules if you need to share users with multiple roles in Clever (i.e., users with both a teacher and a staff account). At this time, Raptor does not support users with dual roles. Raptor will create duplicate profiles if multiple account types sync to the application. To prevent this, you should determine which account type should be shared with the application and set your sharing rules so that only that account is shared.\n\nIf there are staff members you only want to share with Raptor, and none of your other applications, we recommend giving them a title such as “Raptor Only” when creating your Staff.csv file.

For example, if a staff person is at School B today but School A has an emergency, they will be seen as \"missing\" during School A’s emergency because they are physically at School B. The same would apply to students assigned to multiple sites.\n\n---\n\nRaptor doesn't currently support syncing co-teachers/secondary teachers from Clever.

This provides another option for schools and can save Clever admin time.\n\n---\n\nThe default fields exported from Clever to write back are Google email or AD/Entra ID userPrincipalName and passwords for any destination.

Please reach out to Clever Support and we may be able to help.\n\n---\n\nFollow these steps for setting up writeback to your SIS:\n\n1.

We’ve included general information for SISes we know support imports or writeback, but this is not an exhaustive list. If unsure, your best bet is to contact your SIS directly.\n\n**PowerSchool**\n\nThe best way to set up writeback with PowerSchool is using their Data Import Manager (DIM), which supports automated scheduled imports. You can find DIM in PowerSchool by going to **Data & Reporting > Imports.** Learn more about [PowerSchool DIM here](https://ps.powerschool-docs.com/pssis-admin/latest/data-import-manager).\n\nIf you do not need to writeback the Global ID or email fields, you can also use AutoComm instead of DIM. Learn more about [PowerSchool AutoComm here](https://ps.powerschool-docs.com/pssis-admin/latest/autocomm-setup). Clever will deliver AutoComm compliant files to the SFTP box in addition to the standard export files.\n\n**Infinite Campus**\n\nReach out to the Infinite Campus [Technical Services](https://www.infinitecampus.com/services/technical-services) team to explore options for scheduled CSV imports.\n\n**Alma**\n\nAlma doesn't support regular automated imports from files sent to an SFTP folder, but they do support manual import via their import tool. As long as it’s a field in Alma’s import library for that entity, a Clever-formatted CSV can be used. For more information, be sure to reach out to their team directly.\n\nIf you know of any other SISes that support data imports, please let us know by contacting Clever Support and referencing this article!

A field mapping is when you assign the column headers you sync to Clever via CSV upload to a Clever field. You can associate a column header from your uploaded file to multiple required Clever fields. > For example, you could map your school number field to both School\\_id and School\\_number in Clever. Keep in mind that the reverse is not available, as you can’t associate a Clever field with multiple column headers. > This is a useful tool for districts that manage their Clever files and don’t have a way to edit the files they are uploading. For example, if you are using a SIS-Managed Auto Sync and your SIS is not able to edit a file header for you.

By the way, SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language, in case you were wondering!\n\n---\n\nSo technically, SAML is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between two parties. It’s commonly used for single sign-on (SSO), allowing users to sign in once and authenticate securely with multiple third-party applications. SAML is one of the methods Clever uses to help you access a variety of connected applications just by signing in to Clever!\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 258, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:27:34.374681+00:00", "content_hash": "eee4f83916edaaf43b9c07f156570c0954a2c1a1706a89302b3729475d96e728"}

Service Providers coordinate with Identity Providers to authorize and grant access to those services or apps.\n- **Identity Providers**: IdPs (like Active Directory or Google) authenticate the user (making sure you’re you!) and share authorization information with SPs. Identity Providers package the users' information into a well-known format known as a SAML Assertion.\n\nThe thing to know about SAML is that both SPs or IdPs can kick off the sign-in process into an app; it just depends on where you, as the user, visit first:\n\n- If you visit the application first, the application (or SP in SAML terms) will ask the Identity Provider for information about the user and then use that information to process the login, essentially asking the Identity Provider if you’re legit.\n- If you first visit an SSO application (or IdP like the Clever Portal) and then navigate to an application from a list of approved applications, the IdP will forward information to the Service Provider, giving them a heads up that you’re who you say you are.\n\nTo illustrate this, let’s look at the following scenario: \nYou’re attending the Educators of the Year conference (yay, you!). When you arrive, you need to pick up your attendance badge and a color-coded lanyard to allow you into specific sessions at the conference.\n\n![Illustration of service providers and identity providers sign-in process](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Pl000000TmPR&feoid=00N1P00000A2RcS&refid=0EMPl000001js5J)\n\nYou can get your badge and lanyard in one of two ways.", "tokens_estimate": 431, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:27:34.374681+00:00", "content_hash": "eee4f83916edaaf43b9c07f156570c0954a2c1a1706a89302b3729475d96e728"}

Classroom MFA protects applications that use Clever for single sign-on with age-appropriate second factors like Clever Badges or login pictures. This includes the Clever Portal, Google Workspace, and Google Chromebooks. This solution helps districts stay ahead of cybersecurity threats without disrupting learning.\n\n![Classroom MFA protection flow chart](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Pl000000WLvl&feoid=00N1P00000A2RcS&refid=0EMPl00000FZtgx)\n\nBy providing a dual layer of authentication, Classroom MFA can help you meet cybersecurity insurance requirements and worry less about compromised credentials for your students, teachers, and instructional staff. As a bonus, Classroom MFA helps increase students' digital citizenship skills as they navigate our digital environments in a way that's safe and responsible.\n\nClassroom MFA works by requiring a second factor of authentication for students and teachers via Clever Badges, pictures, authenticator apps, SMS, voice calls, or biometrics/hardware tokens, for any Clever-based SSO login. With the ability to require re-authentication for login attempts outside your designated country or network, rest assured potential bad actors will hit your MFA wall and get turned away.\n\n![Clever MFA allows picture logins and Badges for students](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Pl000000WLvl&feoid=00N1P00000A2RcS&refid=0EMPl000005kDDt)\n\n---\n\nThis is a way for your students and teachers to securely MFA into Clever to protect all of your Clever applications without the requirement of a second device. Classroom MFA protects the Clever portal for your users. Any application that a student or teacher accesses from the Clever portal will have a layer of protection.\n\nClassroom MFA currently supports the following factors:\n\n- Picture logins (students only)\n- Clever Badges\n- PIN (students only)\n- Authenticator app\n- Text message (SMS)\n- Voice call\n- Biometrics or security key\n\n---\n\nFor more information on pricing, please contact our team [here](https://www.clever.com/security-consultation).\n\nDistricts can preview Classroom MFA before purchasing [here in your Clever Dashboard](https://schools.clever.com/mfa)!  After completing the configuration and viewing a free preview, IT administrators can purchase Classroom MFA directly in the Clever App Store.\n\nClever’s digital learning platform (including single sign-on, rostering, messaging, and analytics) remains completely free for districts.\n\n---\n\nYou can learn how to get started with Classroom MFA by checking out our article [For Clever Admins: Classroom MFA Setup](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/000001625) or connecting with one of our cybersecurity specialists here: <https://www.getclever.com/mfa-contact-a-specialist>\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 708, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Classroom MFA", "Classroom MFA", "Classroom MFA", "Classroom MFA", "Classroom MFA"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:27:38.507295+00:00", "content_hash": "165f44f34540b9d2f72d72b6fedcfc3e30bbed9851e19d3c246a760c7be0af51"}

Classroom MFA eliminates the need for a second device making it accessible to teachers and students.\n\n**Will Classroom MFA work for my staff users?**\n\n- Yes, your staff will be protected for any applications that are accessed only via single sign-on through Clever. If you would like to learn more or have other requirements for staff users, please connect with a cybersecurity specialist here: <https://www.getclever.com/mfa-contact-a-specialist>\n\n**Can students use the same Clever Badge they already use to log into Clever as their MFA Badge method login?**\n\n- No, a Clever Badge and MFA Badge are not the same thing. For maximum security, we strongly recommend that districts assign an alternative MFA factor for students who already Badge into Clever.\n\n**Which applications are covered by Classroom MFA?**\n\n- Classroom MFA will cover all Single Sign-on (SSO) and Rostering & Single Sign-on (SSO) applications. This includes the Clever Portal, Google Workspace, and Google Chromebooks.\n\n**How can Classroom MFA protect Google?**\n\n- Classroom MFA can protect Google through the Workspace application. Learn how to set up the Workspace app to protect Google for your district [here](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/000001572?language=en_US)!\n\n**How often will students, teachers, or staff be asked to use their second method of authentication?**\n\n- During the MFA configuration process, you'll be able to choose to have users re-authenticate every time they login, every 7 days, or every 30 days. You can also add IP addresses for secure networks (such as your school network) on which you can choose to never require a second factor.\n\n**Can I turn off teacher troubleshooting tools for Classroom MFA?**\n\n- If you configure Classroom MFA for students, teachers will have some tools available in their Portal to troubleshoot login issues for students. For example, teachers can reveal student MFA pictures or reset them. It is not possible to turn off teacher troubleshooting tools for Classroom MFA at this time.\n\n**Can students use Classroom MFA when logging into a Chromebook with a Clever Badge?**\n\n- Yes!

When an end user (e.g. teacher) sets up their MFA, they'll get a list of possible MFA methods to set up. In this step, you'll define what MFA methods will be displayed as possible methods to an end user. It’s a good practice to have at least one other authentication method available to users so they can have a backup method. This way, if they are not able to use one method for any reason (e.g. their cell phone is not charged) they can use a backup method to successfully log in. This saves time by providing an alternative to users. > Picture Logins\n> End-user uses two pictures that they select to verify their identity. Pictures can vary for age group. Younger students can utilize cartoon images, and older students can use realistic pictures. During policy setup, you'll choose which images the policy will use. This method is only permitted for students. Recommended for K-6 students, as it is easy to use. This option does not require a second device. Clever tip: You can set up separate MFA policies for students in younger grades and older grades (ex: K-2 and 3-6) to customize which login pictures students can utilize. > Badges\n> End-user scans a printed or downloaded QR code via a device camera as a second factor after they provide their password. Recommended for students in grades 7-12. It pairs well with a password as the first authentication method. Recommended for teachers as a non-phone alternative. This option doesn't require a second device. Clever admins can bulk print student MFA Badges via the MFA Dashboard. Admins cannot print teacher MFA Badges. Teachers can manage MFA Badges for their students right from their Teacher Portal. Find out more  here . > Please note: If your students already use a Clever Badge to SSO into Clever , we advise against using the MFA Badge as well because it will result in needing two badges to log into Clever.", "tokens_estimate": 494, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Classroom MFA", "Classroom MFA", "Classroom MFA", "Classroom MFA", "Classroom MFA"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:27:47.383937+00:00", "content_hash": "9960556f72281ddb65b4e94d456d9adcbc42922b0d6b89a9136d667c9ebc2174"}

In fact, this piece takes up the bulk of the timeframe during a sync or SIS conversion as we work with your applications to ensure a smooth transition!\n\n---\n\nOur system generates unique Clever IDs for each record based on the sis\\_id that we receive from the district. If student\\_ids, teacher\\_ids, staff\\_ids, or school\\_ids change in Clever, the Clever ID will also change.\n\nChanging user records in this way can cause issues in Clever and connected applications because many of our application partners use the Clever ID as the key identifier in their platform to manage records and preserve historical data. As such, we must notify the application support teams and give them a heads-up! This notification allows the applications to make any necessary changes needed to ingest the new data.\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 414, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:28:01.693524+00:00", "content_hash": "d45f7c50422d8f8976b1c12b023455fe91f45fc74ed4221cf43c9456a3e840af"}

This helps to expedite the conversion process and ensures that everyone is on the same page. **Here are a few things to keep in mind when reaching out to the applications:**\n\n1. The *tentative* date you plan to start the sync or SIS conversion in Clever.\n2. Which SIS data fields will change (eg. student\\_id, teacher\\_number, email\\_address, etc)?\n3. Confirm what key identifier the application uses to manage records and preserve historical data (eg. Clever ID, state\\_id, teacher\\_id, email\\_address, etc).\n4. Does the application have to *match* the data on their end prior to the sync conversion? Or will they need to ingest the new data first and then match it?\n5. Will the application need anything from the district or Clever, such as a crosswalk file of the data changes?\n6. Advise the application that you'll [pause the app sync in the Clever Dashboard](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/000001607) until they confirm that everything is good to go within the application. Request that the application notify you directly once it’s okay to resume the app sync from Clever.\n\n![Screenshot of App sync pause feature, with highlight pointing to the on button](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Pl000000TjOL&feoid=00N1P00000A2RcS&refid=0EMPl000004YzgH)\n\n---\n\nThe Clever team will contact some applications but not all! Our main goal is to contact SSO & rostering applications that use Clever IDs or SIS IDs as key identifiers.\n\nHowever, there are some applications that use other SIS fields (eg. student\\_number, email\\_address, etc.) to preserve data that would also need to be notified, and this is where the district comes in. The district would ultimately be responsible for informing all SSO & rostering applications of the pending changes in Clever.\n\n---\n\n**Is there a list of applications that should be notified?**\n\n- Unfortunately, we don't have a comprehensive list! As such, we recommend notifying all SSO & rostering applications that you’re currently connected with in Clever.\n\n**When should I start reaching out to the applications?**\n\n- The sooner, the better!

For example, when logging into your online bank account, you may be prompted to enter your username and password, and then to verify your login again by entering a text message code sent to your phone. This means you have used two factors to login! A username and password and a text code.\n\nMFA enhances login security and can help prevent unknown logins to student accounts and exposure of sensitive student information called personally identifiable information (PII). It is considered to be an industry best-practice to implement MFA on digital accounts to avoid account compromise by bad actors. Many districts and schools are being required to implement MFA for greater account and data security. Classroom MFA also helps increase students' digital citizenship skills as they navigate our digital environments in a way that's safe and responsible.\n\nClever’s Classroom MFA allows students to securely log into their Clever accounts using two different login methods (or factors) to ensure they are logging into the correct account. Depending on the school district’s settings, Classroom MFA may not necessitate a second device, such as a cell phone, for verification.

Leaving Badges active indefinitely can create security vulnerabilities that put sensitive information at risk. Implementing expiration dates is a vital step in safeguarding your district. > What's changing with Clever Badges\n>  \n> Starting January 1, 2025, all newly created Clever Badges will feature an expiration date and be valid 365 days from their creation date. For example, a Badge created on April 18, 2025, will expire on April 18, 2026 at the same time it was originally created. > Any Badges existing before June 30, 2026  will be active until July 1, 2026 , giving you the flexibility to choose when you want to void and reprint Badges annually. If you generate Badges after June 30, 2026, please check your Badges for their 365 day expiration date. > We suggest voiding and reprinting Badges during your district’s natural transition period, like summer or winter rollover (e.g., void and reprint Badges in July 2026 and annually in July after that). >  \n>  Clever Tip:  Looking for a quick way to refresh your Badges during rollover?

Similar to changing passwords regularly, creating new Badges for your users each year will help mitigate unwanted account access. > Can I opt out of Clever Badge invalidation? > No. Clever Badge invalidation is a tool to help strengthen security for students using Clever Badges. We recommend creating an invalidation schedule that aligns with your school’s natural transition period, such as summer or winter rollover. Voiding and recreating all Badges together during a transition will ensure users have active Badges when they need them most during the school year. > Which badges have the new expiration date? > Existing printed Badges : Printed Badges that have a printed expiration date between January 1 and June 30, 2026, will continue to work until July 1, 2026. For example, a printed Badge that has a May 5, 2026, expiration date will still say May 5, 2026 on the printed badge, but that Badge will be valid and usable until July 1, 2026 Newly printed Badges: If a Badge that was set to expire on any day between January 1 and June 30, 2026, is reprinted, the new Badge will show the updated expiration date of July 1, 2026. This only happens if you choose to reprint the badge. For example, Badges that were set to expire on January 2, 2026, will now expire on July 1, 2026. The same applies to badges set to expire on June 29, 2026. > What if I already have my Badges printed for this school year? > Existing Badges will expire on July 1, 2026. We recommend voiding and reprinting them during a school break preceding this date. >  \n>  \n> Related Articles: \n> Clever Badges: Overview and Setup\n> For Teachers: Clever Badges for Students", "tokens_estimate": 483, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:28:37.308228+00:00", "content_hash": "b24fe0aff68037ac57fb2b242ad7f941524d82e7d5304408d2553fbb32db4a7d"}

[Next steps for teacher <> student communication](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/000001732?language=en_US#header4)\n\nClever will discontinue Clever Messaging on December 31, 2025. We’re proud to have built a teacher < > student messaging product in 2020 to support schools with urgent needs when learning was often pushed fully remote due to COVID-19. As digital tools for classroom communication have expanded, many districts have chosen to implement platforms dedicated to secure messaging, and fewer and fewer teachers and students regularly use Clever for their classroom messaging needs.\n\n---\n\nAs the education technology landscape has evolved, many districts have implemented specialized communication platforms. To ensure Clever is devoting all our resources to delivering the most secure and robust identity platform for education, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue the built-in direct messaging feature between teachers and students. This will help Clever be better positioned to support schools with new, free classroom tools like [Substitute Access](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/000001672) on Clever, Teacher and Student Portals that adhere to accessibility standards, and a faster student iOS app.\n\n---\n\nTeachers and students can continue to message each other directly on Clever until December 31st, 2025. After that date, there will no longer be an option for direct messaging between teachers and students in the Clever Portal. However, your ability to communicate with your students through your Clever Portal isn’t going away entirely.\n\n**The [Class Announcements](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/360045714731?language) feature will remain available**. You can continue to post one-way updates, reminders, or general announcements to all of your students or classes at the same time.\n\n---\n\nYour district has been alerted to this change. If you have questions about how to communicate with students going forward, please reach out to your school's IT team. Many districts already have a dedicated tool in place for secure teacher-to-student messaging that they will continue to use moving forward.\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 648, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Single Sign-on (SSO) & Clever Portal", "Single Sign-on (SSO) & Clever Portal", "Single Sign-on (SSO) & Clever Portal", "Single Sign-on (SSO) & Clever Portal", "Single Sign-on (SSO) & Clever Portal", "Messaging", "Messaging", "Messaging", "Messaging", "Messaging"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:28:59.968013+00:00", "content_hash": "29a93989584e6b4921d218c0fe0372065c9d4436af46ae13ffb3df41a29d992e"}

[Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)](https://support.clever.com/s/articles/000001736?language=en_US#header4)\n\nClever can utilize **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)** to offer a secure and seamless **Single Sign-On (SSO)** experience for users through **identity providers (IdPs)** such as ADFS and Microsoft Entra ID. For this connection to remain secure and functional, Clever and your IdP must use valid security certificates to confirm the user attempting to log in and verify user identities.\n\nIf these certificates expire or Clever or one of your Clever admins rotates them without an update to your IdP, users may experience login failures.\n\n---\n\nYou can think of SAML certificates as digital \"padlocks\" and \"keys\". Clever provides your IdP with a \"padlock\" (public certification), which your IdP uses to lock login data before sending it to Clever. Clever then uses its \"key\" (private key) to unlock it.\n\nFor security reasons, SAML certificates are only valid for a limited period (typically several years). When a certificate reaches its expiration date, it must be replaced with a new one to maintain a secure connection.\n\nTo avoid login errors, you should ensure you are always using the most up-to-date SAML certificate available via Clever.\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 423, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:29:01.176502+00:00", "content_hash": "caf95a9af9fc399132b9099ebc7b32278425d2858609c25daa181493ca28a1ee"}

If two or more records share an ID value, Clever will only process one record with that ID. The following error may be surfaced: *duplicate 'section\\_id (school\\_id, teacher\\_id, student\\_id)' used'*\n\nThese unique IDs are used to make connections between data types and therefore need to be unique and consistent across all 5 files. For example, a school record in your ‘schools.csv’ file with 'School\\_id' “12345” should be identified as “12345” for each student attending that school in the ‘students.csv’ file.\n\n1.

This article explains MFA and how to set it up for your Clever account. > IMPORTANT Secure logins are required for all Clever Admins, either using multi-factor authentication (MFA) or single sign-on (SSO) Why is this required? Login credentials can be subject to malicious attacks, resulting in unauthorized access to personally identifiable information (PII). As a trusted guardian of sensitive data, we want to support you in curbing ever-evolving threats and keeping your logins safe. >    \n> What’s MFA? > MFA is a way to log in to programs that requires you to use two methods (or factors) to prove your identity, like your username and password on your computer and a text message code sent to your phone. You likely already use MFA when signing in to other programs, such as your online bank account. > Please note: If you previously set up two-factor authentication in Clever for your admin account using the Authy authentication app or SMS, you can upgrade your authentication method to a more secure choice such as, Google and Microsoft authenticator apps, hardware tokens, and voice messages. > Having two methods makes it much harder for someone to hack into your account because they’d need to access to both your username/password  and the second method you used to prove your identity.

School districts can add Clever IDM to their free Clever digital learning platform to automate identity management to help keep Google and Active Directory in sync with their SIS. Classroom Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) allows your students and teachers to securely MFA into Clever to protect all of your Clever applications without the requirement of a second device. This solution helps you stay ahead of cybersecurity threats without disrupting learning. You can add this as an optional, paid add-on. > How does Clever generate revenue? > Clever's partnerships with online learning providers (i.e. application partners) are what generate revenue for us. Our application partners pay Clever based on their usage of our  Application Programming Interface (API) . Essentially, they purchase Clever’s technology, including complex integrations with various Student Information Systems (SIS). This allows our partners to focus on their core business needs instead of dedicating time to complicated district setups. With a Clever integration, application partners avoid building and maintaining custom integrations for every district—freeing up resources and streamlining operations. >  For more information regarding application partner pricing, please visit our pricing page here.\n\n>  \n>  \n>  \n> Related articles:\n> Clever's Business Model", "tokens_estimate": 514, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:30:27.278219+00:00", "content_hash": "5026fe87c817589f6e4143714a9431c8468abf908a207599865aada1ea31a491"}

Clever keeps student information safe by ensuring:\n\n- Full district control over data access rights at all times;\n- A robust [privacy policy](https://clever.com/trust/privacy/policy) that governs our use of student data; and\n- Protection through a tested and secure infrastructure.\n\nDistricts control data access at all points in the process, from signup all the way through account provisioning. Districts determine:\n\n- What data Clever can access (always read-only);\n- How often they sync data with Clever;\n- Which applications can access data; and\n- How much data each application can access (via [data sharing permissions](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/203115007)).\n\nDistricts can fine-tune these settings at any time through the Clever Dashboard. If a district chooses to discontinue their Clever sync, they can do so at any time. Clever will delete their account and remove any residual data immediately upon request.\n\nClever syncs basic information to manage user accounts in online learning applications, such as student and teacher identifiers, section names, and enrollment information.\n\nAll rostering data that is synced with Clever is protected by industry-leading infrastructure (see below). Clever will never use or sell student information for marketing or other purposes.\n\nAdditionally, Clever maintains FERPA compliance under the FTC's School Officials Exemption, meaning Clever provides a service on behalf of schools that the schools themselves would usually provide. Furthermore, all Clever-supported applications agree to adhere to FERPA requirements in the terms of our partnership.\n\nTo learn more about data privacy, you can read Clever's full [Privacy Policy](https://clever.com/trust/privacy/policy)", "tokens_estimate": 629, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:30:29.648402+00:00", "content_hash": "ee2cce0eca133d36789a9076f06b90d268aea746b74638a44aaaa451003090bd"}

School year and term rollovers\n> Overview\n> When a district's most recent student information system (SIS) sync to Clever will be changing a significant amount of rostering data, our system initiates an automatic sync hold to prevent the changes from processing until reviewed and approved by a Clever Admin. Sync holds are a safeguard to avoid potentially incorrect or undesired changes from being processed and synced to connected applications. These holds are essential to the sync process as they ensure that Clever Admins are aware of potentially significant changes to their Clever data. Without holds, a district could experience unintended changes to data, which could negatively impact users and connected applications. > Please note:  Significant changes to custom data can also trigger a hold. Holds are not limited to only your synced data. > As shown below, when a sync is on hold, Clever Admins can select the Review Hold option under the sync hold alert or can review the information from their Clever Dashboard > Data sources > SIS sync  page before accepting or declining the changes. An email will also be sent to the district's Clever Admins who have their  Sync emails enabled . >  \n> If the deletions for schools, students, teachers, or staff exceed 95%, and the Clever Admin chooses to accept the changes, a Clever support ticket will be automatically created to be reviewed by a Clever Support agent.

Because Clever requires sections to process data, our system can automatically create sections for these students based on their teacher. Please submit a request to Clever Support with a list of your schools (name and school number) and we will program our system to create sections in these schools.

The schools.csv is required even if you’re a single school. This is how Clever’s sync system will know to associate your teacher and students with the school. > Do I need to include a sections.csv file? > Yes! The sections.csv file is how Clever syncs your classes and assigns students to their class(es). Even if you only have one section/class per grade, a sections.csv is required. The section\\_id can be any unique value that is kept consistent across the section.csv and enrollments.csv. If you’re making your own files, our team recommends keeping it simple and using single numbers (section\\_id = 1, section\\_id = 2 for each section/class). > How do I know if my data upload went through? > A sync will occur any time data is successfully uploaded to Clever. They generally take 15-30 minutes to complete.\n\nIf you’ve uploaded new data to Clever, please give the sync at least 30 minutes to complete.

URL Name 203166807 Article Body This article contains the following:  1. Overview 2. How does SSO authentication work? 3. Single sign-on (SSO) Requirements 4. Additional SSO options\n> Overview\n> Clever single sign-on (SSO) enables users to securely authenticate into connected applications via Clever Portal. Users log into Clever just once with one set of credentials, or using a Clever  Badge , and then click on the various app icons to be logged in automatically via SSO. Clever application partners rely on Clever's verification system of determining that a user is, indeed, who they say they are. Without Clever SSO, each application would need to maintain its own database of users and their credentials. > How does SSO authentication work? > A user logs in to Clever via the district's Identity Provider (IDP) (e.g. Active Directory, Google, etc.) from the Clever login page. Clever authenticates the user through the district's IDP. If the user is verified, Clever creates a \"token\" (i.e. a piece of data) that identifies the user and then logs them in successfully. The user then clicks on the appropriate application icon to open an application, and Clever provides the user's token to the application which authenticates the user. This means the user does not need to enter login credentials a second time. The user is logged into the application successfully! > Clever Tip: The Clever Portal also supports universal single sign-on for non-integrated Clever applications via SSO (Saved Passwords) authentication. Read more about this here ! > Who can use single sign-on (SSO)? > The following users can access applications through Clever single sign-on (SSO):\n> Students Teachers Staff District admins\n> Please note that each individual learning application determines which of the user types listed above they support.

If there are multiple records in Clever for the same user, users may not be able to log in. The only caveats to this are teachers who are also considered staff and have both a teacher and staff account in Clever , or district admins who are also teachers or staff. > 2. District Portal URL\n> Each district has the ability to customize a unique Clever login page URL to share with district users. This URL is a direct way for users to log in rather than navigating to Clever.com and selecting their school. Custom URLs are in the format of  https://clever.com/in/<YOUR  CUSTOM SHORTNAME>  (e.g. https://clever.com/in/northernschooldistrict)   Your district's Portal URL can be customized from the Clever Dashboard > Portal > Portal settings page in Clever.

As long as you provide one of Clever’s accepted subject values, Clever will use the exact value you provide.\n\nIf you’re syncing data with Clever via Auto Sync, you’ll want to determine which field is used to sync subjects to Clever, then populate that field with the above subject values.\n\n- If you’re using a [Clever-Managed Auto Sync](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/articles/202289278#Clever-Managed%20Automatic%20Sync), contact [Clever](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) Support to determine which SIS field is used for subject.

Change the value of section ‘name’ or ‘course\\_name’**\n\nIf you’re not able to sync a ‘subject’ field to Clever, we will make our best guess based on the terms included in the section ‘name’ and ‘course\\_name’ fields. To improve accuracy, try some of these tips:\n\n- Include one of Clever’s subject values in your section or course names.\n- Use full terms whenever possible. For example, “comp” is interpreted as “composition” (subject: “english/language arts”), not “computers” (subject: “technology and engineering”).\n- Creative names can sometimes be miscategorized, so opt for simple and commonly used terms. For example, “astronomy” gets matched to “science”, whereas “rocket ships” would be matched to “other”.\n\n---\n\nClever makes the best-educated guess to sort each section into the above subjects.

Review section\\_ids\n> For term rollover, it is important to make sure that the ID #s for sections (the section\\_id field in Clever) are different after a term or school year rollover.

If you have any questions about where to find your section\\_id based on your sync type, please do not hesitate to contact Clever Support! >   4. Changing SIS IDs (student\\_id, teacher\\_id, etc.)\n> During term rollovers, there are many districts that approach Clever about changing the primary identifiers (commonly called SIS IDs) for one or more record types. The following values are SIS IDs in Clever: \n> Student\\_id Teacher\\_id Staff\\_id School\\_id Section\\_id\n> Clever highly advises against changing these values in the middle of a school year. Doing so presents a significant risk of loss of historical data for users mid-year. If your district has a critical need to adjust SIS IDs mid-year, please reach out to Clever support for consultation. Commonly the need to change the SIS ID for users is due to a district needing to meet the data requirements for a specific connection. Clever Support may be able to help you meet this data requirement without disrupting your existing data in Clever.

This approach ensures that managing a student’s resources doesn't inadvertently grant an admin unnecessary permissions or data exposure within those third-party apps. > If you want to learn more about your Clever Dashboard, check out our  article here . > If you’re interested in learning more about organizing your school’s Clever Portal, keep reading below!", "tokens_estimate": 499, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:31:06.510576+00:00", "content_hash": "1c99dc1fbebdee99968f36178c5ac32b2c3f2133a2809be8e9635cd37e5bb63b"}

This approach minimizes the attack surface of your district’s data by ensuring users only have access to the specific tools they need. To support this, we have intentionally separated Portal Management from Admin SSO Access: Portal management: This functionality is now available in the Admin Dashboard. Icons in the “Organize District Portal” tab are intentionally non-clickable to prevent administrative accounts from having \"blanket access\" to applications by default. The Admin Portal: This remains the Admin hub for SSO into resources provisioned to Admin accounts. If you need personal access to a specific application, it must be scoped to your account. Once provisioned, it will appear as a clickable icon in your personal Portal. Why the change? By decoupling these experiences, we ensure that managing a student’s resources doesn't inadvertently grant an admin unnecessary permissions or data exposure within those third-party apps. > If you notice that applications you previously accessed via your Portal are no longer present, please follow these troubleshooting steps in our FAQ . > To take a look at the previous Portal management experience compared with the updated experience, check out the video below:\n> Previewing the Portal\n> As is mentioned above , only School Tech Leads can edit individual school Portals, however, administrators can view school Portals.

Overview 2. How do I use claims rules? 3. Defining the Field in Clever 4. Applying the claims rules to single sign-on (SSO)\n> Overview\n> When users sign in to their Identity Provider to use single sign-on (SSO), the identity provider sends us a piece of data and tells us which field in Clever contains matching data. Using this, we can identify the user and give them access to their applications. > Claims rules define which attributes are sent to Clever from the identity provider and which fields Clever should use to perform the match. You will need to find a claims rule for each user type (e.g. students, teachers, staff, etc.) that you want to use single sign-on (SSO). > Please note:  Claims rules are only necessary for Active Directory, Lenovo Stoneware / webNetwork, LDAPS, and Office 365 / Entra ID. > How do I use claims rules? > Picking the right identity provider attribute  \n> First, look at the data in your Clever account - you can click on a record in the Clever Dashboard > Data browser   to view all the information that’s currently synced in Clever. > Next, compare the data in Clever to the data attributed to users in your identity provider (IdP). Are there matches? In order for users to be able to log in, the data in the IdP attribute and the data in the field in Clever must match exactly. > Additionally, make sure you’re picking something that’s unique across all users.

For example, student\\_id “009844” becomes “9844”. When uploaded, Clever no longer recognizes that student: student “009844” is deleted and a new student, “9844”, is created. Once this incorrect data, caused by leading zeros, is uploaded to Clever, it may cause a hold due to changes in data. If the hold is approved, those unique SIS IDs can cause many issues, such as users or sections being re-created and losing their associated historical data in connected apps.

Clever provides districts with end-of-year and rollover guides to help them to plan for summer and the new school year rollover. No data from the district's student information system (SIS) will be synced to Clever during a sync pause. Essentially, the data in Clever will be \"frozen in time\" during the sync pause period. Depending on the district's school year dates, data will typically begin syncing again between August 1st and August 12th.\n\n- **First [Pause] Day**: This will be the first day the district’s sync is paused, which should coincide with the district’s last day of the school year.\n- **Last [Pause] Day**: This will be the last day the district’s sync is paused, which should be the day before the district’s SIS data is active for the new school year.\n\nWhile a district's sync is paused, Clever will not process any data, allowing the district to make rostering changes to their SIS without interrupting student or teacher access to your application(s). The prior school year's data will be \"frozen\" in Clever for the duration of the district's pause, allowing the previous school year's users to continue logging into your application without disruption.\n\nWhile pausing a sync prevents SIS-synced data from processing in a district's Clever account and, therefore, updating in their applications, Clever does provide the ability for Clever Admins to create custom data directly from their [Clever Dashboard > Data sources > Custom data](https://schools.clever.com/custom-data) page during a sync pause. This includes custom students, teachers, staff (i.e., school admins), and sections.

Once a district's pause has ended and the data for the new school year has synced to Clever, their sync will be placed on an automatic hold, allowing Clever Admins the opportunity to review the data updates before the changes process in Clever. Once reviewed, the district can submit a request to release the sync hold from their [Clever Dashboard > Data sources > SIS sync](https://schools.clever.com/sync) page. Please note that if the changes are above a certain threshold, a ticket will then be created with Clever Support to review the changes before the sync hold is officially released.

Clever authenticates the user through the district's IDP. If the user is verified, Clever creates a \"token\" (i.e. a piece of data) that identifies the user and then logs them in successfully.

Here’s how it works:  \n> Clever redirects the user to a special URL for your application, along with a code. Your application automatically uses the code to ask Clever for a token that grants additional access to our API. Clever checks the code and the application credentials to make sure they are valid before returning an API token. Your application uses the API token to get basic information about the user - at the very least, it will get the district id, user Clever id, and user type. Depending on your implementation, your app may then search for the user in your existing database and/or provision an account for the user. >  \n> Troubleshooting\n> While it looks simple to the end user, there’s definitely a lot of moving parts!

There are two methods for using Clever with Google Chromebooks:\n\n**1) Users use Clever Badges to log into Chromebooks, then access Clever.**\n\n- Students open their Chromebooks and scan their Clever Badge.\n- This automatically logs the students into their Chromebooks and Clever Portals (they do not need to log in again).\n- Students can click on any learning application to begin their learning session.\n\n**2) Users log into Chromebooks manually, using credentials, and then access Clever.**\n\n- Students open Chromebooks and log in with their district-provided Google login credentials.\n- After logging in, the district’s Clever Portal is automatically opened for them (i.e., students do not need to log in again).\n- Students can click on any application icon to begin their learning session.\n\nDepending on your preferences, each method can be configured separately for different Organizational Units (OUs) in your Google Admin Console.\n\nFor either of the login flows above, Clever can be configured as either an organization-wide identity provider (IdP) for Google or an SSO Profile. Clever does recommend using the SSO Profile setup. For instructions on setting up Clever as an SSO Profile in Google, please see [this article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/000001645).  For instructions on setting up Clever as an organization-wide IdP, please see [this article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/000001541).\n\n---\n\nBelow are some troubleshooting tips we put together in case you see unexpected issues logging into Chromebooks with Clever Badges.\n\n1. Create a test Organizational Unit (OU) and apply the Clever Badges settings to the OU.\n2. Choose a student to test and generate a Clever Badge for them. Note, this must be a real student unless you have a test user with a Google account syncing with Clever.\n3. Move that student to the test OU.\n4. Move the Chromebook you’re using to the test OU.\n5. Log into the Chromebook using the student’s Clever Badge.\n\n- ***Require a change of password on the next sign in*** \n Users are unable to log in using SSO when the **reset password on first login** functionality in the Admin Console is active. Make sure you're not using this functionality for any users accessing Google using SSO, including a Clever Badge login to a Chromebook. This is a limitation of Google SSO Using 3rd Party IdPs. For more details on this topic see[**this article from Google**.](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60224?hl=en)\n- *Generate Clever Badges.* Make sure you’ve generated Clever Badges for your users.

Test the Clever Badge by using it to log in at <https://clever.com/in/badges>. If that login isn’t working, the badge is likely invalidated. You may have to generate a new Clever Badge for the student.\n- Check your Clever sync for Google email addresses. Students using Clever Badges to log into Chromebooks should have Google email addresses synced to your Clever account. Clever uses this information to match users with their Google accounts. You can always check your synced data via the [Clever Dashboard > Data browser](https://schools.clever.com/browser#%7B%22sidebar%22:%22schools%22%7D).\n- Confirm if Google is allowed in your network filters, including <http://accounts.google.com/signup/oauth>**.**\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 381, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin", "Clever Admin"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:31:51.579365+00:00", "content_hash": "6d29dda93141937bdcafa21fa3fd50174e54f131578081c8dd1c8bbd0390c5de"}

As long as the user does not power off the device or manually log out, their active session will be preserved.\n\n**Can we use Clever Badges if our students and devices are on separate domains?**\n\n- If the domains are in the same Google Workspace, yes.

If the students and devices exist on separate domains in different Google Workspaces you won't be able to configure Badges into Chromebooks.\n\n**Do we need to require forced logout upon idle or lid close?**\n\n- No. These settings are recommended if devices are being shared by multiple users.

This is not guaranteed, as the district could change its sync pattern or miss a sync. Other districts sync data in an irregular pattern, and in those cases, we cannot predict the next sync.\n\nUnderstanding a bit about the different sync types provides clarity on a district's sync frequency as well.\n\n---\n\nAn Auto Sync with Clever involves a basic initial setup. It requires minimal IT support from a district, as Clever syncs directly with the district's SIS to securely transfer student roster data.

This means di stricts can provide users with a seamless SSO experience for almost any learning application even if it is not an existing Clever partner. With the SSO (Saved Passwords) option, rostering data and user accounts are not synced to the app by Clever. This means they must be created within the application in advance, and user login credentials need to be manually set by the district admin, or by the users themselves. Clever will securely store these credentials so district users are logged into the applications automatically via single sign-on through Clever. This article and the video below provides a detailed overview of SSO (Saved Passwords) applications and the setup process for launching these apps at your district. >  \n>  \n> Getting started\n> District user accounts and credentials for the app:\n> The first step is to confirm your district users have accounts and login credentials for the SSO (Saved Passwords) application. This would be done by working with the app partner directly before setting the app up in Clever. > Non-iOS devices:\n> The second step is confirming the Clever browser extension is installed on all non-iOS devices that will be used to access the application through Clever. This includes home devices for users who will be accessing this app from home. The Clever browser extension facilitates single sign-on for SSO (Saved Passwords) apps.

With the ease of only one username and password, Clever can help teachers reclaim valuable class time. Students and teachers can open their devices, sign into the Clever Portal, and click on their connected applications to automatically access the online learning program! > Clever Tip: If you notice that data is missing or incorrect in Clever or one of your connected learning applications, you’ll want to reach out to your district tech support contact to verify that the data is syncing from your Student Information System (SIS) and included in the sharing permissions for the application. Clever is unable to make changes on the district's behalf. > Who can sign up for Clever? > We recommend creating one Clever account for your school district that’s managed at the district level. In order to create and administer a Clever account, you need administrative access to your SIS and authority to sign Clever’s Terms of Service. > Examples of individuals with sufficient access to manage a Clever account include Chief Technology Officers, SIS/Database Managers, and other district IT Administrators. Non-teaching staff, such as Principals, typically do not have the access to the SIS that is needed to set up a Clever account, therefore we recommend reaching out to a colleague at the district level to create your district’s Clever account. > How can I access my district's Clever account? > If you’d like access to Clever as a non-teaching staff member, we encourage you to reach out to your district’s tech department.\n\nThe Clever account owner must upload your non-teaching staff record to the Clever dashboard.

URL Name 236113588 Article Body This article contains the following: 1. Overview 2. Auto Syncs 3. SFTP Syncs 3. Changing Syncs\n> Overview\n> Think of Clever Secure Sync as a bridge between your Student Information System (SIS) and online learning applications. Secure Sync maintains up-to-date roster information in your learning applications by securely transferring your roster uploads or connecting directly with your SIS. Clever is engineered to be the most secure and convenient way for districts to send vendors data and grant access to learning applications. > The Secure Sync process can be summarized in four steps:\n> Your school district’s data syncs to your Clever account through an Auto Sync or an SFTP sync. Sharing permissions with each connected application are set up to determine which data to share with that application. Applications pull all available data from your Clever account, typically on a nightly basis. Student, teacher, and staff accounts are automatically created in the applications. From that point on, applications regularly update any changes to your enrollment information as indicated in your Clever account. > Continue reading to learn about Clever’s different sync types. With all Clever sync types, the school district has complete control over data access and management of the Clever account. > Please note: Clever can only connect to one student information system (SIS) per district account. If your district uses more than one SIS, you will need to set up more than one Clever account. > Auto Syncs\n> An Auto Sync with Clever involves basic initial setup and requires minimal IT support from your district because Clever syncs directly with your SIS to securely transfer student roster data.

Districts generate multiple files in a Clever-specific CSV format and submit them to Clever using Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). The SFTP sync allows districts to upload data using an FTP client or Clever’s Web Upload tool. Districts control exactly what data to include in their upload files, therefore this option provides districts a greater level of customization but requires more robust setup and management. Clever also recommends automating the process of exporting data from your SIS and uploading it to Clever.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n>  \n> Overview\n> Badges allow students to hold up a physical badge to their device's webcam to get logged in, instead of typing in usernames and passwords. Badges are perfect for students who have trouble typing or remembering complex passwords - especially younger learners. Teachers get more time to teach, and students get more time to learn! > Badges are tied to the student. As such, changes in school, teacher, or section will not affect the Badge. > If the administrators on your district's Clever account have enabled Badges there are several ways you can manage Clever Badges as a teacher. You can print, regenerate, and void Badges for individual students, print Badges for whole classes, and even void Badges for all students en masse at the end of a school year. >  \n> Please note: If you do not see the option to download student Badges, from your Student Roster tab, this means that Badges are not enabled for your district, school, or grade level. Please reach out to your district's tech support for more information. >   \n> Pro Tip: Security Badges provide direct access to a student's Clever account and should be protected just like a password. Anyone who has access to a Badge can sign in as the student and access their accounts in both Clever and connected applications.

Students hold their physical Clever Badge up to their device camera to log in. However, students often still need to enter a username and password in order to access their device to get to Clever. To simplify that experience, we also offer Badges into Windows for devices that utilize Active Directory logins. When you set up Badges into Windows, students can log in to their device and  Clever with just their Badge. > Student experience\n> For students, the login experience is simple. The device's login screen prompts them to scan their Clever Badge. They hold the Badge up to the camera, which instantly logs them into the device, Clever, and all of their Clever applications. > If your district or school is using shared Windows devices for students, the device will remember the login option the previous user selected.

The answers to these questions will vary depending on the terms of your current contract. Most contracts follow the same general structure but reach out to [accounts-receivable@clever.com](mailto:accounts-receivable@clever.com) with any questions.\n\n---\n\nClever bills by billable schools or users shared depending on your contract. For questions, [contact support](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/contactsupport).\n\n---\n\nWe only charge for schools that are explicitly shared and launched.\n\n**Explicitly shared:** This excludes any schools that are shared via dually enrolled users. For example, student X is enrolled in classes at both Clever Middle School and Clever High School. Clever Middle School is shared with your application, but Clever High School isn't. We'll provide access to both school objects via the API, but will only bill for Clever Middle School.\n\n**Launched:** We only bill for launched connections, giving you time to test and get set up! Read more about setting launch dates [here](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115005704686).\n\n---\n\nPartners are billed annually upfront for the contracted annual platform fee. For partners that exceed the amount included in the agreement (overage), these will be billed based on the number of connections at the time of overage multiplied by months left in your contract. You'll receive an invoice that covers how much your overage is.\n\n---\n\nYou're billed for any schools or users shared through **launched** district connections on the last day of the month that haven't been filtered out from within your Clever Dashboard. If a school is connected midway through the month, you will still be charged full price for that school for the month.\n\n---\n\nView the number of schools or users you’ll be billed for any given month on the **Billing** tab of your Clever dashboard.\n\nWithin the billing tab, you can select a billing period by navigating to **Billing period as of**.\n\n- This is updated nightly.\n- This data represents the total number of shared schools and users in launched district connections.\n- The number excludes any schools or users you’ve filtered out from within your Clever dashboard.\n- Schools or users shared multiple times are only counted once for billing purposes.\n\nFrom the billing tab, you can:\n\n1. Change the billing period to see what you were billed for in previous months.\n2. Request to have a CSV emailed to you for all of the schools or users you're currently being billed for to keep for your records.\n\n---", "tokens_estimate": 1125, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:33:05.097660+00:00", "content_hash": "b0c2a56c6b9ab1777f5b0683a138a9f48c732e7a2e911ffb87c56f9d89ac329b"}

We recommend looking at the tab monthly to avoid any over-sharing issues before your monthly invoice.\n\nIf a district shares too much data, there are two ways to remedy this.\n\n1. Reach out to the district to request that they [adjust their sharing settings](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/203115007) so that the appropriate amount of data is shared with your application. If the district needs assistance, they can submit a ticket to our Support Team [via the Help Center form](https://support.clever.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).\n2. You can also use the application-side filtering tool to remove excess data from the API. Any schools filtered out using this tool will also be removed from all future invoices. For more information on how to filter excess data, please see this article: [Creating filters for district data](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115003249203?language=en_US)\n\nFinally, you can use our License feature to flag those districts that are oversharing so that you can check this in a programmatic way through your Clever dashboard. For more information on how to set up licenses for a district in your dashboard please see this article: [Setting Up License Usage Limits](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115003921667)\n\n---\n\nWe have a few tools that help surface when a district shares too much data with your application.\n\nThe first is the licensing feature. This feature allows you to set the number of school or student licenses a district has purchased for your application. If a district exceeds the number of licenses, you and the district will be notified in the Clever dashboard. For more information on the licensing feature, please see [this article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115003921667).\n\nApplications can now create filters to receive only the needed data, giving you control over data sharing and enhancing integration quality. For instructions on how to set up filters, please see [this article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115003249203?language=en_US).\n\nSmarter data sharing allows you to recommend sharing settings to districts that are connected with your app. You can send updated recommendations even after districts have enabled data sharing with you. [This article](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/360046189771?language=en_US#h_f723888c-6033-4cba-b3fa-f30388209a1b) covers how to send sharing recommendations to a district.\n\nAs mentioned above, you are only charged for launched connections. If a district isn't ready to launch, you can modify the launch date to be further into the future until they are set up to begin using the application. This will allow them to set sharing permissions, resolve data quality errors, and complete all their steps on the district end before you begin getting billed for the shared data. More information about setting launch dates can be found here: [For App Partners: Managing district launch dates](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/115005704686?language=en_US).\n\n---\n\nWe provide access to schools that aren't explicitly shared with your application for users who are associated with multiple schools in Clever. As a result, you might see a school with very limited teacher, section, and student data. You aren't billed for schools not explicitly shared with your application via Clever.\n\n---\n\nYou're invoiced based on the number of unique schools shared with your application via Clever. ‘Shared schools’ is defined by the total number of unique Clever IDs available to your application via the API, not by the total number of unique MDR numbers. This data doesn't always align perfectly with MDR data, depending on how the district has structured their schools in their SIS.\n\n---\n\nNeed help?

Sharing rules let Clever know which of your data you'd like to make available to an application, and which users should be able to access an application via Clever. Clever will not share data with an application until your district sets the application’s sharing permissions. The application will only appear on the Portal for teachers, students or staff that have been shared with the application.\n\n---\n\nAs a School Tech Lead you are only able to update sharing rules for applications that say, **School site sharing**, under the *Sharing* column on the [Applications](https://clever.com/oauth/district_admin/login?target=%3BbzRrcGh2aDJ5Z252eDgzdnhjNjQ%3D%3BaHR0cHM6Ly9zY2hvb2xzLmNsZXZlci5jb20vYXV0aC1jYWxsYmFjaw%3D%3D%3BYTdiYWZhYWUxZDM1YjNmZjQ5ZmFhNDc4ZTkwYWU3M2IyN2FkNDE4YWUyZTY5Y2I2ZGRmYTUwYTZmM2M0ZGM1Mg%3D%3D%3BY29kZQ%3D%3D%3BZGlzdHJpY3RfYWRtaW4%3D) tab.

We recommend thinking through the following points to help you make informed decisions about the best summer school options for your district:\n> Who will specifically need access to Clever and connected learning applications over the summer? (e.g. all students, teachers, and staff, or only a subset of users, etc.)? Which Clever resources do district users need to access or utilize over the summer? Will your district need to add new users over the summer or before the start of the new school year? Will data need to be dynamically updated in Clever via your student information system (SIS) sync, or will a Clever admin be managing the manual summer school updates in Clever?

These are the individuals who directly manage a classroom and students. Teachers in Clever have unique tools and features that allow them to facilitate digital learning in the classroom. Some resources available to teachers in Clever include:\n> Clever Library Login Tools Teacher Pages   Teacher Analytics\n>  \n> Staff\n> \"Staff\" is the term Clever uses to refer to staff who are not directly in charge of a classroom (e.g., principal, front desk, counselor, etc.). Clever has two user roles associated with the staff user type:\n> Portal Access :  This is the default role provided to staff members in Clever. This role provides permissions to access the Clever Portal and any shared applications. School Tech Lead : This role in Clever has additional permissions that allow them to manage the Clever Portal on a school-by-school basis. >  \n> Can a user be both staff and teacher? > Yes! An individual can be both a teacher and staff in Clever. In most instances, these users can access both user accounts using the same set of credentials. Districts can link teacher and staff accounts as long as the email for each record matches (this includes case sensitivity). If the user has one account syncing from your student information system, and you need to make a custom account for another role for that user, that's totally fine!

Students in a given section will have an active enrollment in Clever during the dates of that term. When a term ends, students in those sections no longer have an active enrollment.

These are the same user type in Clever but are represented with different titles depending on if you are a district or application partner. >  \n> In early 2019, we re-branded the \"School Admin\" user type to \"Staff\" for our district partners. This included updated titles in the district dashboard, deprecation of our admins.csv file, and introduction of the staff.csv file. >  \n> How do districts sync staff to Clever? > The staff role is designed for users that are not connected to rosters but need access to applications, including school admins! By default, all staff users are created as  Portal Access only users, meaning they'll have access to the Clever Portal for Single Sign-On (SSO) into applications just as students and teachers do. However, staff can be assigned the role of School Tech Lead which offers additional administrative capabilities. > Depending on a districts sync type, there are four ways that districts can sync staff users to Clever:  \n> Uploading staff via CSV Sync staff with Active Directory Using Infinite Campus API or Skyward API syncs Custom data: staff\n> What districts see\n> The district-facing Data Browser  shows staff under a single tab titled  Staff .

This proven format generates a 10% increase in user engagement with your application.\n\nThe structure of this guide was developed in response to teacher feedback: *the biggest barrier to using an app is finding the time and energy to get it set up.*\n\n![](/servlet/rtaImage?eid=ka0Pl000000CKJ7&feoid=00N1P00000A2RcS&refid=0EM1P00000285gv)\n\nOnce your Quickstart Guide is published in Clever, your app detail page will show a link that teachers can access anytime, and any teacher that installs your app from the Library will be notified and nudged to use your guide if they have not yet logged in and used your application. Sometimes, teachers just need a reminder and easy steps - and Clever is here to help with that!\n\nTeachers can immediately launch your application from the Quickstart Guide.\n\n- Log in to Clever\n- Navigate to Library > Teacher Quickstart Guide in your left hand navigation menu\n- To begin, first input *Account Syncing* information. The answer is **yes** only if your application requires teachers to take an additional action after Clever sends your app the rostering data. Example actions:\n - Teacher is required to click a button to ‘sync’  their class from Clever.\n - Teacher is required to upload or input their classes into the application\n- Fill out the following *How to use* steps. Your application must fill out a minimum of 1 step, and can fill out a max of 3 steps. Note that there is a character limit per step to improve readability for teachers.\n\nA successful Quickstart Guide is one that motivates teachers to launch the application and take the simple steps involved in setup. A less successful guide might contain accurate *Getting Started* content, but may ultimately feel too complex for teachers to launch at that moment.\n\nTips:\n\n1. Avoid linking to your website’s help center articles instead of writing the essential content within Clever\n2.

Switching rostering methods:  If you’re moving to Clever from self-registered accounts, please be ready to work with McGraw Hill on a user clean-up process to delete old data (students & possibly teachers). If you’re switching from a different method, McGraw Hill may have to re-match your historic customer data with your shared Clever data to retain historical data. Data readiness: Your district should be sending Clever term and course data. McGraw Hill requires term data in order to create courses, classes, users, etc. Not having this will prevent your district from proceeding. Stable course data will allow your district to more easily assign digital content (e.g. so classes receive the correct textbooks) prior to launch. Interoperability: If you plan on having users access McGraw Hill from platforms outside of Clever (e.g. Canvas), please be prepared to send Clever the same unique user ID you use to identify those users on other platforms (e.g., SIS ID) in your SIS sync. >  \n> Setup Process\n> 1.

Once this logic is disabled, Clever will look to your SIS data as the source of truth for primary school assignments instead of the student or teacher's sections.

Access control is intended as a temporary measure to limit potential student, teacher, or staff access to course-related information during sensitive time periods. When logging in to the Clever Portal or some connected applications, students, teachers, and staff are able to infer some information about which students and teachers are assigned to which classes (such as if they log into a reading app via Clever and see that they’re listed under 5th Period ELA with Ms. Thompson). By using access control, district admins can prevent students, teachers, and staff from viewing course-related information in Clever Portal or their connected applications by disabling login access. > Please note: Users may still be able to log into third-party applications if the applications support login methods other than Clever. >  \n> Setting up access control\n> You can set up access control by following these steps:\n> Navigate to Clever Dashboard > Authentication > SSO settings page.

If you are moving between major versions in production, please reach out to our [Partner Engineering team](mailto:integrations@clever.com) to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nWithin a major version, you can freely make calls against any associated minor version (for example, you could use both 2.0 and 2.1, but not 3.0) by updating your URLS (e.g. <https://api.clever.com/v2.1/district>).\n\nFor detailed information on changing API versions, check out our developer documentation on [Upgrading to the latest version of Clever’s API.](https://dev.clever.com/docs/migrating-to-api-30#teachers-staff-district-admins)\n\nWe define a minor release as one that will only add new features (e.g. response fields, input parameters, endpoints, etc) and fix small bugs. Minor versions will be backwards compatible.\n\nMajor version releases may contain features that are not backwards compatible as well as feature deprecations.\n\nClever is committed to releasing planned API versions no more than once a year, based on the following release timeline:\n\n- New API versions will be announced by November.\n- Rostering (data and events) API versions should be released by December.\n- Identity API changes should be released by March.\n\nAny delay in this timeline will be communicated to customers in advance. In case of an emergency, Clever reserves the right to release an API version outside of this schedule to meet customer needs with proactive communications to partners.\n\nWhen a new version is fully released, new applications will build to the newest API version, and will not be able to use any previous version of the API.\n\nWhile we consider new versions code complete upon official release, we recognize that bugs can slip by our testing processes! For three months after a version is released, we will make updates to the version to fix any discovered bugs. Once three months have passed, we will freeze the version as-is and make no further updates.\n\nWe sometimes need to make changes to all API versions - if we do, we will communicate this with partners as soon as possible.", "tokens_estimate": 771, "updated_at": null, "breadcrumbs": ["Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner", "Application Partner"], "tags": [], "scraped_at": "2026-02-08T02:37:12.095601+00:00", "content_hash": "35d8257b2258c477062d317557f07d43db1bac9776c43fcfbc6485d2438c0ec9"}

This policy aligns with industry best practice to ensure a great front-end experience for you and your customers. This means that when a new major version is released, we will begin the deprecation and end of life process for the oldest major version.\n\nWe are committed to ensuring that deprecation goes smoothly for all customers. Therefore, the deprecation and end of life process is as follows:\n\n- At least one year in advance of deprecation, Clever will send notice of deprecation to all partners. We will also reach out to partners who are using the API version to help determine their upgrade path and timeline.\n- Once an API version is deprecated, Clever will provide only limited support for bug fixes.\n- An API version will no longer be supported six months after it is deprecated. At this point, applications will be unable to access any of the version’s endpoints.\n\nUpon announcement of API v3, we are officially beginning the deprecation and end of life process for API v1, which includes both v1.1 and v1.2.

Richer staff data to enable access to all users who support student learning. Improved student contact relationships\n> Utilize a student relationships array, which details each contact’s relationships with any students in the district’s Student Information System (SIS). For example, if a contact is listed as a parent for two students and an aunt for another, they will have one Clever ID and three entries in the student\\_relationships array. Please note: Clever has deprecated the API v2 contacts endpoint. If you require assistance, please contact Clever Support. > New content/resource mapping API\n> This feature allows districts to indicate via the API which resources they want shared with courses, classes, and users. > Access to five new demographic data fields: Disability Status, Primary Disability Type, Section 504 Status, Gifted/Talented Status, and Home Language Code.
